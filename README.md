# IK1203 Networks & Communication

The course is an introduction to networking, protocols and communication.

We study how large international networks are constructed from the individual computers, via local area, city and national networks. We use the Internet as or working example of such a network. The aim of the course is to give insights into both the theory and practice of the area.

The focus of the course is on the protocols and algorithms used, and we will follow how they are used and implemented into the TCP/IP-stack - the basis of the Internet.
